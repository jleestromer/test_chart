# Highcharts Stock Test

This repository contains a simple demo implementing the requirements from the technical document.

The `web` folder hosts a small React based page that renders a candlestick chart using **Highcharts**. It includes:

- Ticker input with two dummy symbols (`AAPL` and `GOOG`).
- Ability to toggle four predefined SMA lines (10, 20, 50 and 100).
- Random OHLCV data for one year for each symbol.
- Responsive behaviour and dynamic redraw when options are changed.

Open `web/index.html` in a browser to try the demo.
